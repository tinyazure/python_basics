## Python Fundamentals ðŸš€

This material is designed to kickstart your journey into Python programming, especially if you're just starting out. Whether you're completely new to coding or curious about how Python works, you're in the right place!

You'll learn all the core concepts of Python by solving practical exercises we call challenges. Each challenge is crafted progress in each challenge and help you build coding skills step by step, while keeping things interactive.
